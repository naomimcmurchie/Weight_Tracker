` I am going to build a weight tracker app on this project.`

1. create a folder Weight_Tracker on my PC, `mkdir` Weight_Tracker

2. creat a README.md file in Weight_Tracker folder. `touch` README.md - I will write down my notes here.

3. create a new repository in github, and push my change here.



4. create a file name 'main.py' type 'Welcome to Weight Tracker' and run in terminal
